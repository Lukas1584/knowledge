man dnf.conf / man yum.conf

The minimal repository configuration file should aside from repo ID consists of baseurl, metalink or mirrorlist option definition.
REPO OPTIONS
       baseurl
              list

              List of URLs for the repository. Defaults to [].

              URLs are tried in the listed order (equivalent to yum's "failovermethod=priority" behaviour).

       cost   integer

              The  relative  cost  of accessing this repository, defaulting to 1000. This value is compared when the priorities of two repositories are the same.
              The repository with the lowest cost is picked. It is useful to make the library prefer on-disk repositories to remote ones.

       enabled
              boolean

              Include this repository as a package source. The default is True.

       gpgkey list of strings

              URLs of a GPG key files that can be used for signing metadata and packages of this repository, empty by default. If a file can not be verified  us‐
              ing the already imported keys, import of keys from this option is attempted and the keys are then used for verification.

       metalink
              string

              URL of a metalink for the repository. Defaults to None.

       mirrorlist
              string

              URL of a mirrorlist for the repository. Defaults to None.

       module_hotfixes
              boolean

              Set this to True to disable module RPM filtering and make all RPMs from the repository available. The default is False.  This allows user to create
              a repository with cherry-picked hotfixes that are included in a package set on a modular system.

       name   string

              A human-readable name of the repository. Defaults to the ID of the repository.

       priority
              integer

              The priority value of this repository, default is 99. If there is more than one candidate package for a particular operation, the one from  a  repo
              with the lowest priority value is picked, possibly despite being less convenient otherwise (e.g. by being a lower version).

       type   string

              Type of repository metadata. Supported values are: rpm-md.  Aliases for rpm-md: rpm, repomd, rpmmd, yum, YUM.


REPO VARIABLES
       Right side of every repo option can be enriched by the following variables:

       $arch
          Refers to the system’s CPU architecture e.g, aarch64, i586, i686 and x86_64.

       $basearch
          Refers  to  the  base  architecture of the system. For example, i686 and i586 machines both have a base architecture of i386, and AMD64 and Intel64 ma‐
          chines have a base architecture of x86_64.

       $releasever
          Refers to the release version of operating system which DNF derives from information available in RPMDB.

       In addition to these hard coded variables, user-defined ones can also be used. They can be defined either via variable files, or by using special environ‐
       mental variables. The names of these variables must be prefixed with DNF_VAR_ and they can only consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores:

          $ DNF_VAR_MY_VARIABLE=value

       To use such variable in your repository configuration remove the prefix. E.g.:

          [myrepo]
          baseurl=https://example.site/pub/fedora/$MY_VARIABLE/releases/$releasever

       Note that it is not possible to override the arch and basearch variables using either variable files or environmental variables.

       Although users are encouraged to use named variables, the numbered environmental variables DNF0 - DNF9 are still supported:

          $ DNF1=value

          [myrepo]
          baseurl=https://example.site/pub/fedora/$DNF1/releases/$releasever
